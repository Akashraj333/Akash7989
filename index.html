    <p id="Disaster">
        <b>1)</b> After completion of intermediate, I took B.com(computers) in degree. I studied in the same college i.e, Emerald's degree college which is affiliated to sv university.<br>
        <b>2)</b> With that degree i have taken CMA(cost management accounting).<b> Why i taken means iam a topper so that's why i taken.</b> But i failed.<br>
        <b>3)</b> Then i realise i am average student. But the sad thing is both cma inter and degree 4th sem exams are clashed and <b>my brain said to write cma inter exam</b> .<br>
        <b>4)</b> But again failed so that i have 4 subjects pending even though i am not fail in that. So that's why i mentioned 4th sem as pending.<br>
        <b>5)</b> Now i have writtened the exam, So that my graduation is completed. I want to study MCA(Master Of Computer Application) and i went to svce college they we don't give admission, because u have 4 subjects backlog. Then i decided to take course.
